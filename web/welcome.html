        <h3 align="center">How it works</h3>
        <p>
A Galaxy framework is equipped with <i>alternative</i> Galaxy tools
that are able to address the same biological problem in a different,
sometimes more suitable way. Alternative tools can, for example,
offer different sensitivity, speed, memory usage, as well as distinct
sets of parameters and features.<br />
For these reasons, to build Galaxy workflows, users are required to
choose tools on the basis of their suitability within the context of
the target analysis. However, shared best-practice training materials
do not uniformly cover their usage, and the growing landscape of
computational tools have not made this task any simpler.
        </p>
        <p>
We address these issues with the <b>Galaxy workflow generator</b>.
In this Galaxy instance we present alternative interactive tours to
carry out each operation within the desired analysis, and provide
breef descriptions of the pros and cons associated to their usage.
We call these set of alternative units <i>atoms</i>, and hand to the
user the possibility to select the preferred one to build customized
Galaxy workflows.<br />
This design allows users to compare different tools before selecting
the most appropriate one, and provides equal visibility to the
available alternative algorithms of a Galaxy instance.
        </p>
        <p>
The Galaxy workflow generator provides alternative atoms for the
construction of RNA-Seq as well as BS-Seq workflows.<br />
Atoms are presented as alternative items of a multipl-choice list,
which is rendered by means of a developed plugin enhancing the
Galaxy interfaces with novel pop-up dialogues. User-selected atoms
are then illustrated through dedicated interactive tours, which
users can follow to parametrize tools and customize their workflows.<br />
The <b>Figure</b> below illustrates how the process of selecting
atoms and building workflows takes place. Here, a user is carrying
out an RNA-Seq analysis, which is divided into its 3 main tasks: 1)
Quality control and data preprocessing, 2) Genome alignment, 3)
Transcript quantification and differential gene expression. For each
task, the user selects the desired atom in the front-end interface,
and navigates the corresponding interactive tour. The interactive
tour drives the execution of each underlying tool in the Galaxy
back-end. Once each task has been completed, the resulting workflow
(traced in red), will thus be composed of the series of alternative
tools of each selected atom, parametrized according to the
interactive tour.

Prospective contributors can create new atoms and related help pages,
and install the necessary tools from the <a href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu">Galaxy Tool Shed</a>.
New atoms can target different types of analyses and leverage on new
tools. Moreover, existing Galaxy instances can be extended with the
atoms paradigm by installing our developed plugin.<br />
Instructions on how to carry out this process are maintained on <a href="https://github.com/destairdenbi">our GitHub repository</a>.
